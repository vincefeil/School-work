# Square Wave Generator ReadMe

## The purpose of this project
    To use the Micro-Bit to generate a variable square wave that can be
    used to experiment with timing circuits and counters. The generator starts at 1hz
    (500ms pulse width) at 3.2v. Output is on pin0.

### Operation
1.	To increase the frequency press button B. This shortens the pulse width by 100ms each press.
2.	To decrease the frequency press button A. This lengthens the pulse width by 100ms each press.
3.	To display the pulse width press buttons A and B at the same time. This shows the ms divided by 100.
